A selection of teaching materials created over the years by Daniel S. Buckstein

### Dear readers and lifelong learners: 
I have been teaching a variety of game programming topics for many years, and I have recently decided to publish some of my materials.  Many students who have used these materials (and take them seriously) have found gainful and relevant employment upon graduation... so I like to think the materials do the trick!

Here you will (eventually) find a variety of things like sample slide decks, lesson plans, assignments, quiz questions, rubrics, and other goodies that have helped me teach the art and science of real-time programming and engineering.  Some of the things are a bit older, or may contain some things that I have been meaning to replace or rephrase.  Please be respectful and consider that, at the end of the day, everything is all designed for people who have not experienced this subject matter before.  Any limitations in knowledge that you may perceive are deliberate; sometimes I have to hold myself back!

Have fun and feel free to contact me with questions/comments/suggestions!

-Dan
